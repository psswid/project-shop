HTML5/CSS3/Bootstrap3/jQuery/Php7/MySQL ecommerce train project

This is my very first shopping cart and PHP project written in procedural programming approach. 

This is good example how not to code websides so I keep it as token of memory.

Lack of security, probably lots of opprtunities for sql inject.

As for the first a bit bigger project i learned a lot, like creating admin panel with crud to manage products and orders , mysqli,
creating product displays, forms in bootstrap modals.
